    "ciq_answer_score": 8,
    "cohere_generated_answer": "The speed and direction of wind are influenced by several factors, including:\n\n- Frictional Force: This force affects the speed of the wind and is greatest at the surface, extending up to elevations of 1-3 km. It is minimal over the sea.\n\n- Coriolis Force: The rotation of the Earth deflects the wind to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. The deflection is more pronounced when wind velocity is high.\n\n- Pressure Gradient Force: Differences in atmospheric pressure create a force that influences wind direction. The pressure gradient is stronger when isobars are close together and weaker when they are apart.\n\n- Gravitational Force: Acting downward, this force generally balances the vertical pressure gradient force, preventing strong upward winds.\n\nThese forces, along with the horizontal pressure gradient and the Coriolis force, shape the velocity and direction of winds near the Earth's surface, with friction playing a role at lower altitudes.",

    "cohere_generated_answer": "The Coriolis force is a phenomenon that influences the direction of wind and results from the Earth's rotation. In the Northern Hemisphere, the Coriolis force causes the wind to deflect to the right. This force, described by the French physicist in 1844, is proportional to the angle of latitude and is strongest at the poles, while absent at the equator. It acts perpendicular to the pressure gradient force, which is responsible for the wind's velocity. The Coriolis force, along with the pressure gradient force and frictional force, determines the wind's velocity and direction near the Earth's surface.",

    "ciq_answer_score": 9,
    "cohere_generated_answer": "The pressure at sea level is higher than at higher altitudes primarily due to the effect of gravity. Gravity causes the air at the surface to be denser, resulting in higher pressure. This is known as atmospheric pressure, and it decreases with height. At sea level, the average atmospheric pressure is 1,013.2 milibars, and it decreases as elevation increases. This vertical variation of pressure is a crucial factor in understanding atmospheric circulation and weather systems.",

Frictional force, caused by the interaction between air and surfaces like land or water, affects wind speed, with greater friction at lower altitudes. The Coriolis force deflects wind direction, with a rightward deflection in the Northern Hemisphere and leftward in the Southern Hemisphere. Pressure differences between areas of high and low pressure create pressure gradient forces, causing air to move from high to low pressure, resulting in wind.
