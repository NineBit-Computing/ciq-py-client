  "cohere_generated_question": "What are the factors that contribute to the formation of a tropical cyclone?",
  "ciq_generated_answer": "\"The factors that contribute to the formation of a tropical cyclone are: (i) Large sea surface with temperature higher than 27 C; (ii) Presence of the Coriolis force; (iii) Small variations in the vertical wind speed; (iv) A pre-existing weak-low-pressure area or low-level-cyclonic circulation; (v) Upper divergence above the sea level system.\"",
  "ciq_answer_evaluation": "CIQ's answer is factually accurate and covers all the relevant information from the provided text. However, it could be improved by explaining the significance of each factor in the formation of tropical cyclones, which would enhance clarity and provide additional context.",

  "cohere_generated_answer": "The formation of tropical cyclones is influenced by a combination of factors, including: \n- Sea surface temperature: Tropical cyclones require sea surface temperatures higher than 27\u00b0 C to draw energy from the ocean through evaporation.\n- Coriolis force: The rotation of the Earth creates this force, which causes the wind to deflect and spiral around an area of low pressure.\n- Vertical wind speed variations: Small differences in wind speed at different altitudes contribute to the development of a vertical circulation, facilitating the upward movement of warm, moist air.\n- Pre-existing low-pressure area: A weak low-pressure system or a low-level cyclonic circulation acts as the initial disturbance, around which the tropical cyclone develops.\n- Upper-level divergence: Divergence above the sea level system, where air spreads out and creates a region of low pressure aloft, promotes upward motion and aids in the development of the cyclone.",
