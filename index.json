  "cohere_generated_question": "How does the Coriolis effect influence the direction of wind in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres?",
  "ciq_generated_answer": "\"The Coriolis effect influences the direction of wind differently in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. In the Northern Hemisphere ([3]), it deflects the wind to the right direction, whereas in the Southern Hemisphere, it deflects the wind to the left direction. This is due to the rotation of the Earth, which causes the Coriolis force to act differently based on the hemisphere's location. The strength of the Coriolis force is directly proportional to the angle of latitude ([6]). At the equator, where the angle of latitude is zero, the Coriolis force is zero, and the wind blows perpendicular to the isobars ([5]).\"",
  "ciq_answer_evaluation": "CIQ's answer is factually accurate and covers all the relevant information from the provided text. It is clearly worded and easy to understand, providing a concise explanation of the Coriolis effect and its influence on wind direction in both hemispheres. Well done, CIQ!",

  "cohere_generated_answer": "The Coriolis effect is a phenomenon that influences the direction of wind in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres differently. Due to the Earth's rotation, the Coriolis force causes the wind to deflect to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. This effect is more pronounced at higher latitudes, with the force being directly proportional to the angle of latitude. At the equator, where the latitude is zero, the Coriolis force has no impact, and the wind blows perpendicular to the isobars. This effect plays a crucial role in atmospheric circulation and weather systems, influencing the direction and speed of winds globally.",
