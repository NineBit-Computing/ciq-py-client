  "cohere_generated_question": "What is the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and why is it important?",
  "ciq_generated_answer": "\"The Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) is a region where the trade winds from both sides of the equator converge. It is important because it significantly influences weather patterns and climate across the tropics, including rainfall distribution.\"",
  "ciq_answer_evaluation": "CIQ's answer is factually accurate and covers all the relevant information about the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). However, the wording could be improved for clarity, especially regarding the impact of the ITCZ on weather patterns and climate. The phrase 'including rainfall distribution' is vague and could be expanded upon.",

  "cohere_generated_answer": "The Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) is a region near the equator where the trade winds from the Northern and Southern Hemispheres converge. This convergence zone is significant because it plays a crucial role in shaping weather patterns and climate across the tropics. The ITCZ influences rainfall distribution and the formation of tropical cyclones, which can have devastating impacts on coastal regions. The ITCZ is a dynamic feature that migrates seasonally, following the sun's apparent movement, and influences the distribution of pressure systems and wind patterns.",
