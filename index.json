  "cohere_generated_answer": "Tropical cyclones, including hurricanes and typhoons, originate over warm tropical oceans due to specific conditions. These conditions include sea surface temperatures exceeding 27\u00b0 C, the presence of the Coriolis force, small vertical wind speed variations, pre-existing low-pressure areas, and upper-level divergence. These factors contribute to the formation and intensification of tropical cyclones, which can cause significant destruction when they make landfall.",
