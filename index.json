  "cohere_generated_answer": "Tropical cyclones originate over warm tropical oceans. The formation and intensification of these storms require specific conditions, including sea surface temperatures higher than 27\u00b0C, the presence of the Coriolis force, small variations in vertical wind speed, and a pre-existing weak low-pressure area. The energy that fuels tropical cyclones comes from the condensation process in towering cumulonimbus clouds, and the continuous supply of moisture from the sea strengthens the storm.",
