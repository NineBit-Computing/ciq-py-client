    "ciq_answer_score": 8,
    "cohere_generated_answer": "The speed and direction of wind are influenced by several factors, including:\n\n- Frictional Force: This force affects the speed of wind and is strongest at the surface, extending up to elevations of 1-3 km. It is minimal over the sea.\n- Coriolis Force: The rotation of the Earth deflects wind to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. The deflection is more pronounced at higher wind velocities and latitudes, and it is absent at the equator.\n- Pressure Gradient Force: Differences in atmospheric pressure create a force that influences wind direction. The pressure gradient is stronger when isobars are close together and weaker when they are apart.\n- Gravitational Force: Acting downward, this force generally prevents strong upward winds.\n- Other factors: The text also mentions forces acting on the wind without specifying them, and pressure differences between areas, which cause wind to move from high-pressure to low-pressure areas.",

    "ciq_generated_answer": "\"The Coriolis effect refers to the deflection of wind direction due to the Earth's rotation. In the Northern Hemisphere, this deflection causes winds to be deflected to the right when looking towards the direction of wind movement (referred to as a cyclonic or clockwise rotation in the Northern Hemisphere). This is because the Earth rotates counterclockwise from the perspective of an observer standing on its North Pole. The Coriolis force is directly proportional to the angle of latitude, meaning it has a more significant effect at higher latitudes compared to the equator where the Coriolis force is zero and wind blows perpendicular to the isobars.\"",
