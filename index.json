  "cohere_generated_question": "Why do tropical cyclones only form over the sea?",
  "ciq_generated_answer": "\"Tropical cyclones originate over the sea because they intensify over warm tropical oceans, as stated in [3].\"",
  "ciq_answer_evaluation": "CIQ's answer is factually accurate and complete, but could be clearer by providing more context. It does not explain why tropical cyclones need warm ocean conditions to form, which is a key factor mentioned in the text.",
  "ciq_answer_score": 7,
  "cohere_generated_answer": "Tropical cyclones form over the sea due to the presence of warm ocean waters, which provide the necessary energy for their formation and intensification. The warm ocean surface, in combination with other factors like the Coriolis force and vertical wind variations, creates the conditions for these violent storms to develop.",
