  "cohere_generated_question": "Why does the Coriolis force not affect wind direction near the equator?",
  "ciq_generated_answer": "\"The Coriolis force does not affect wind direction near the equator because at the equator, the angle of latitude is zero (as per [3] in the context). Since the Coriolis force is directly proportional to the angle of latitude, it has no effect on the wind direction.\"",
  "ciq_answer_evaluation": "CIQ's answer is factually accurate and complete, but could be clearer. It correctly states that the Coriolis force is absent at the equator because the angle of latitude is zero, and this has an effect on wind direction. However, the response could be improved by explaining that the Coriolis force deflects wind direction, so its absence means there is no deflection and thus no effect on wind direction near the equator.",

  "cohere_generated_answer": "The Coriolis force does not influence wind direction near the equator because it is directly proportional to the angle of latitude, which is zero at the equator. This means the Coriolis force has no impact on the wind near the equator, allowing it to blow perpendicular to isobars without deflection.",
