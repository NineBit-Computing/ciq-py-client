    "cohere_generated_answer": "The Coriolis effect is a phenomenon that influences the movement of objects, such as wind, due to the rotation of the Earth. In the context of wind direction, the Coriolis effect causes deflection of wind to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. This deflection is a result of the Earth's rotation and is more pronounced when wind velocity is high. The Coriolis force is directly proportional to the angle of latitude, meaning it is strongest at the poles and absent at the equator. This force acts perpendicular to the pressure gradient force, which is the force that drives air movement from high-pressure areas to low-pressure areas. The interaction between these two forces results in the cyclonic circulation of wind around low-pressure systems and anti-cyclonic circulation around high-pressure systems. In the Northern Hemisphere, the wind blows in a counterclockwise direction around a low-pressure system and clockwise around a high-pressure system. The Coriolis effect, along with the pressure gradient force and frictional force, influences the velocity and direction of wind near the Earth's surface.",

This convergence creates a zone of low pressure, attracting moist air and causing it to rise due to convection. The rising air cools and condenses, forming clouds and often leading to heavy rainfall. This process influences the general circulation of the atmosphere by creating a band of low pressure and associated weather systems around the equator, which then affects the movement of air masses and weather patterns globally.",

Friction acts as a force opposing the motion of wind, particularly near the Earth's surface, and its effect decreases with increasing altitude. The Coriolis effect, resulting from the Earth's rotation, deflects wind to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. Pressure differences between areas of high and low pressure create a pressure gradient force that drives wind from high-pressure regions to low-pressure regions.
