  "ciq_generated_answer": "\"The key factors that determine the speed and direction of wind, based on the provided information, are Frictional Force (affecting the speed) and the net result of wind generating forces, which includes Pressure.\"",
  "ciq_answer_evaluation": "CIQ's answer is factually accurate and covers the key factors determining wind speed and direction. However, it could be more comprehensive by mentioning other forces like Coriolis and pressure gradient forces, which are also crucial in influencing wind patterns. The answer is clear and concise, but a brief explanation of how these factors interact to shape wind patterns would enhance clarity.",

  "cohere_generated_answer": "The speed and direction of wind are influenced by a combination of factors, including frictional force, pressure gradient force, Coriolis force, and the net result of wind-generating forces. Frictional force, caused by the roughness of the Earth's surface, affects wind speed and is strongest near the surface, especially over land. The pressure gradient force drives air movement from high-pressure areas to low-pressure areas. The Coriolis force, due to the Earth's rotation, deflects winds in the northern hemisphere to the right and in the southern hemisphere to the left. These forces, along with the net result of wind-generating forces, collectively determine the speed and direction of wind.",
