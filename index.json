  "cohere_generated_question": "What is the Coriolis effect, and how does it influence wind direction in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres?",
  "ciq_generated_answer": "\"The Coriolis effect refers to the deflection of moving objects, such as wind, caused by the Earth's rotation. In the Northern Hemisphere, winds are deflected to the right (clockwise), while in the Southern Hemisphere, they are deflected to the left (counterclockwise). This effect influences the direction of winds around systems on Earth. The Coriolis force is directly proportional to the angle of latitude, meaning its influence increases as you move away from the equator. At the equator, where the Coriolis force is zero, wind blows perpendicular to the isobars.\"",
  "ciq_answer_evaluation": "CIQ's answer is factually accurate and covers all the relevant information about the Coriolis effect and its influence on wind direction. The explanation is clear and easy to understand, providing a good overview of the topic.",

  "cohere_generated_answer": "The Coriolis effect is a phenomenon that influences the direction of moving objects, such as wind, due to the rotation of the Earth. In the Northern Hemisphere, the Coriolis effect causes winds to deflect to the right, following a clockwise direction. Conversely, in the Southern Hemisphere, winds are deflected to the left, following a counterclockwise direction. This effect is more pronounced away from the equator, with its influence increasing as you move toward the poles. At the equator itself, the Coriolis force is zero, resulting in wind blowing perpendicular to the isobars. This effect plays a crucial role in determining wind patterns and atmospheric circulation in different parts of the world."
