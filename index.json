  "cohere_generated_question": "What are the factors that contribute to the formation of a tropical cyclone?",
  "ciq_generated_answer": "\"The factors that contribute to the formation of a tropical cyclone are: (i) Large sea surface with temperature higher than 27 C; (ii) Presence of the Coriolis force; (iii) Small variations in the vertical wind speed; (iv) A pre-existing weak-low-pressure area or low-level-cyclonic circulation; (v) Upper divergence above the sea level system.\"",
  "ciq_answer_evaluation": "CIQ's answer is factually accurate and covers all the relevant information from the provided text. However, the wording could be improved for clarity, especially regarding the distinction between 'vertical wind speed' and 'vertical variation of pressure'.",
  "ciq_answer_score": 8,
  "cohere_generated_answer": "The formation of tropical cyclones is influenced by a combination of factors, including: \n- Sea surface temperature: Tropical cyclones require sea surface temperatures higher than 27 degrees Celsius to form and intensify.\n- Coriolis force: The rotation of the Earth affects wind direction, with deflection to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere.\n- Vertical wind speed variations: Small changes in vertical wind speed can impact the development of a tropical cyclone.\n- Pre-existing conditions: A weak low-pressure area or low-level cyclonic circulation is often necessary for the initial formation.\n- Upper-level divergence: The presence of divergence above the sea-level system can contribute to the development and organization of a tropical cyclone.",
