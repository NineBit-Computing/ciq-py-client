  "ciq_generated_answer": "\"Tropical cyclones originate over the seas because they intensify over warm tropical oceans. (Context: [2])\"",
  "ciq_answer_evaluation": "CIQ's answer is factually accurate and complete, but could be clearer. It states that tropical cyclones originate over the seas due to intensification over warm tropical oceans, which is correct. However, it could provide more context or detail to make the answer more comprehensive.",
  "ciq_answer_score": "8",
  "cohere_generated_answer": "Tropical cyclones originate over the seas due to the presence of warm ocean waters, which provide the necessary heat and moisture for their formation and intensification. These storms require sea surface temperatures higher than 27\u00b0 C, along with other factors like the Coriolis force and specific wind conditions, to develop and strengthen.",
