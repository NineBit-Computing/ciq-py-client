  "ciq_generated_answer": "\"Tropical cyclones originate over warm tropical oceans, as stated in points [2] and [4].\"",
  "ciq_answer_evaluation": "CIQ's answer is factually correct and complete, but could be clearer. It states that tropical cyclones originate over warm tropical oceans, which is accurate and addresses the question. However, it refers to 'points [2] and [4]' without explicitly mentioning what these points are, which could be confusing for someone who doesn't have access to the source document. Providing more context or quoting the relevant points directly would improve clarity.",

  "cohere_generated_answer": "Tropical cyclones originate over the seas because they require warm ocean water, typically with a temperature higher than 27\u00b0 C, to form and intensify. The warm ocean surface acts as a source of energy and moisture, which are essential for the development and sustenance of these storms. Additionally, the presence of the Coriolis force, small variations in vertical wind speed, and other atmospheric conditions specific to tropical regions contribute to the formation of tropical cyclones.",
