  "cohere_generated_answer": "Tropical cyclones form over seas because they require warm ocean conditions to develop. These warm tropical oceans provide the necessary energy for the storm's intensification through the condensation process in towering clouds. The Coriolis force, small vertical wind speed variations, and pre-existing low-pressure areas also contribute to their formation.",
