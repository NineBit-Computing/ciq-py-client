  "ciq_generated_answer": "\"The four types of fronts that occur when two different air masses meet are: (a) Cold; (b) Warm; (c) Stationary; (d) Occluded.\"",
  "ciq_answer_evaluation": "CIQ's answer is factually correct and complete, identifying the four types of fronts that occur when two different air masses meet. However, the answer could be made clearer by providing a brief description or explanation of each type of front, particularly the less commonly known 'occluded' front.",

  "cohere_generated_answer": "When two distinct air masses meet, four types of fronts are formed: cold, warm, stationary, and occluded fronts. Cold fronts occur when a cold air mass advances and replaces a warmer air mass, leading to a rapid drop in temperature and the potential for storms. Warm fronts, on the other hand, are formed when a warm air mass moves and lifts the cooler air ahead of it, resulting in a gradual temperature increase. Stationary fronts arise when neither air mass is strong enough to replace the other, creating a prolonged period of consistent weather. Occluded fronts are the most complex, occurring when a cold front overtakes a warm front and lifts the warm air, often leading to a variety of weather conditions.",
