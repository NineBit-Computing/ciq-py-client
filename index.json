  "ciq_generated_answer": "\"Tropical cyclones originate over warm tropical oceans, as stated in context [2].\"",
  "ciq_answer_evaluation": "CIQ's answer is factually accurate and complete, but it could be clearer. It does not explicitly mention the specific conditions required for tropical cyclone formation, which are mentioned in the text. A more detailed answer would improve clarity and provide additional context.",
  "ciq_answer_score": 7,
  "cohere_generated_answer": "Tropical cyclones originate over warm tropical oceans due to specific conditions: sea surface temperatures exceeding 27\u00b0C, the presence of the Coriolis force, small vertical wind speed variations, weak low-pressure areas, and upper divergence above the sea level system. These factors, combined with a continuous supply of moisture from the sea, contribute to the formation and intensification of tropical cyclones.",
