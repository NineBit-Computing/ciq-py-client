    "cohere_generated_answer": "The speed and direction of wind are influenced by multiple factors, namely:\n\n- Frictional Force: This force opposes the motion of wind and is strongest at the surface, particularly over land. It generally affects wind up to elevations of 1-3 km.\n- Coriolis Force: The rotation of the Earth about its axis affects the direction of wind. In the Northern Hemisphere, wind is deflected to the right, and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere.\n- Pressure Gradient Force: Differences in atmospheric pressure create a force that influences wind direction. Wind generally blows from high-pressure areas to low-pressure areas.\n- Other Factors: The text also mentions other forces, such as the gravitational force acting downward, but does not provide specific details about them in this context.",

This force deflects wind to the right in the northern hemisphere and to the left in the southern hemisphere. The deflection is more pronounced when wind velocity is high.\n\n- Pressure Gradient Force: Small differences in atmospheric pressure create a force that influences wind direction and velocity. The pressure gradient is stronger when isobars are close together and weaker when they are apart. Wind blows from high-pressure areas to low-pressure areas.\n\nAdditionally, the gravitational force acts downward, and the Coriolis force is balanced by the pressure gradient force, resulting in geostrophic winds blowing parallel to isobars when there is no friction.",

    "ciq_generated_answer": "\"The Coriolis effect is a force that causes moving objects, such as wind, to deviate from their straight path due to the Earth's rotation. In the Northern Hemisphere, the Coriolis force deflects the wind to the right (clockwise). In contrast, in the Southern Hemisphere, the Coriolis force deflects the wind to the left (counterclockwise). This effect influences the overall direction of winds around systems on Earth. The strength of the Coriolis force is directly proportional to the angle of latitude, meaning it has a more significant impact on wind direction as you move away from the equator. At the equator, where the angle of latitude is zero, the Coriolis force is absent, and the wind blows perpendicular to the isobars (lines of equal air pressure).\"",

    "cohere_generated_answer": "The Coriolis effect is a phenomenon that influences the direction of moving objects, such as wind, due to the Earth's rotation. This effect causes the wind to deviate from its straight path as it moves across the planet. In the Northern Hemisphere, the Coriolis effect deflects wind to the right, while in the Southern Hemisphere, it deflects wind to the left. This deflection is more pronounced at higher latitudes, with the force being directly proportional to the angle of latitude. As a result, the Coriolis effect has a significant impact on wind direction in the mid-latitudes and polar regions, but it is negligible at the equator. The Coriolis effect plays a crucial role in the overall circulation of the atmosphere and the formation of weather systems, influencing the movement of air masses and the development of storms.",
