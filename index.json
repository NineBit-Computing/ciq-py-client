  "ciq_generated_answer": "\"The key factors that influence the speed and direction of wind, according to the provided context, are:\\n\\n  1. Frictional Force\\n  2. Rotation of the Earth\\n  3. Pressure (implied as a force affecting wind movement)\"",
  "ciq_answer_evaluation": "CIQ's answer is factually accurate and covers all the key factors influencing wind speed and direction. However, it could be clearer by providing a bit more context or explanation, especially for those unfamiliar with these concepts.",

  "cohere_generated_answer": "The speed and direction of wind are influenced by several factors, including: \n\n- **Frictional Force**: Friction affects wind speed and is strongest at the surface, extending up to elevations of 1-3 km. It is minimal over the sea.\n\n- **Coriolis Force**: The rotation of the Earth deflects wind direction. In the Northern Hemisphere, wind is deflected to the right, and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. The deflection is more pronounced at higher wind velocities and latitudes.\n\n- **Pressure Gradient Force**: Differences in atmospheric pressure create a force that influences wind direction. Wind generally blows from high-pressure areas to low-pressure areas.\n\n- **Gravitational Force**: Acting downward, this force generally prevents strong upward winds.\n\nThese forces, particularly the pressure gradient, frictional, and Coriolis forces, interact to determine the speed and direction of wind near the Earth's surface.",
