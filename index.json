  "cohere_generated_question": "How do air masses form and what are their characteristics?",
  "ciq_generated_answer": "\"Air masses form when air remains over a homogenous area for a sufficiently longer time, acquiring the characteristics of the area. These homogenous surfaces are called source regions. There are five types of air masses recognized: (i) Maritime tropical (mT); (ii) Continental tropical (cT); (iii) Maritime polar (mP); (iv) Continental polar (cP); (v) Continental arctic (cA). The characteristics of these air masses depend on the source region they originate from. For example, maritime air masses are typically moist and warm, while continental air masses are dry and hot in tropical regions and cold in polar regions.\"",

  "cohere_generated_answer": "Air masses are formed when air remains over a homogenous area, such as vast ocean surfaces or plains, for an extended period, acquiring the characteristics of that region. These areas, known as source regions, can be classified into five types: maritime tropical (mT), continental tropical (cT), maritime polar (mP), continental polar (cP), and continental arctic (cA). The characteristics of these air masses depend on their source region, with maritime air masses being moist and warm, while continental air masses vary based on their region, being dry and hot in tropical regions and cold in polar regions.",
