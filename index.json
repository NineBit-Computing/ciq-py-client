  "cohere_generated_question": "What is the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and how does it contribute to the formation of tropical cyclones?",
  "ciq_generated_answer": "\"The Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) is a region where the easterlies from either side of the equator converge. This zone contributes to the formation of tropical cyclones because it provides the warm tropical oceans necessary for their origin and intensification, as stated in context [3]. However, tropical cyclones are not formed exactly at the equator due to reasons mentioned in context [5].\"",
  "ciq_answer_evaluation": "CIQ's answer is factually accurate and complete, providing a clear and concise explanation of the ITCZ and its role in tropical cyclone formation. However, it could have included more detail on the specific conditions the ITCZ creates that facilitate cyclone development.",

  "cohere_generated_answer": "The Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) is a region near the equator where the easterly trade winds from the Northern and Southern Hemispheres converge. This convergence of warm, moist air creates a band of low pressure and high rainfall around the Earth's equatorial region. This zone is crucial for the formation of tropical cyclones due to the warm ocean temperatures and rising air it promotes, providing the necessary conditions for these storms to develop and intensify. Tropical cyclones do not form directly on the equator itself due to the weak Coriolis force, which is essential for the spinning motion of these storms.",
