    "cohere_generated_answer": "The speed and direction of wind are influenced by several factors, including:\n\n- Frictional Force: Friction affects wind speed and is strongest at the surface, extending up to elevations of 1-3 km. It is minimal over the sea.\n- Coriolis Force: The rotation of the Earth deflects wind to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. The effect is more pronounced at higher wind velocities and latitudes, and absent at the equator.\n- Pressure Gradient Force: Differences in atmospheric pressure create a force that influences wind direction.

    "ciq_answer_score": 9,
    "cohere_generated_answer": "The Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force are two factors that influence the direction and velocity of winds. The Coriolis force, caused by the Earth's rotation, deflects winds to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. This force is proportional to the wind velocity and acts perpendicular to the pressure gradient force. The pressure gradient force, caused by differences in atmospheric pressure, determines the initial direction of wind flow from high-pressure areas to low-pressure areas. The higher the pressure gradient force, the faster the wind blows. The interaction between these two forces results in deflections in the wind's path, with the specific direction depending on the balance between the forces. The Coriolis force also depends on the latitude, being maximum at the poles and absent at the equator. These forces, along with friction, shape the patterns of wind circulation near the Earth's surface and in the upper atmosphere.",
