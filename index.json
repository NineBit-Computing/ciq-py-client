    "cohere_generated_answer": "Tropical cyclones are violent storms that originate over warm tropical oceans, typically forming over large bodies of water with temperatures exceeding 27\u00b0 C. The Coriolis force, small vertical wind speed variations, pre-existing low-pressure areas, and upper divergence above the sea level system are among the conditions necessary for their formation and intensification.",

    "ciq_generated_answer": "\"The Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) is a region where the easterlies from both sides of the equator converge. It is important because it is a place where conditions are favorable for the formation and intensification of tropical storms. This is due to the presence of large sea surfaces with temperatures higher than 27 degrees Celsius, the Coriolis force, small variations in vertical wind speed, a pre-existing weak-low-pressure area or low-level cyclonic circulation, and upper divergence above the sea level system.\"",

    "ciq_answer_score": 8,
    "cohere_generated_answer": "The Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) is a region near the equator where the easterly trade winds from the Northern and Southern Hemispheres converge. This zone is significant because it creates conditions favorable for the formation and intensification of tropical cyclones or hurricanes. The ITCZ is characterized by warm sea surface temperatures exceeding 27 degrees Celsius, which provides energy for the storms. Additionally, the Coriolis force, which deflects winds due to the Earth's rotation, plays a role in the development of these storms. The interaction of these factors with other conditions, such as vertical wind speed variations and pre-existing low-pressure areas, makes the ITCZ a crucial region for understanding tropical storm dynamics.",
