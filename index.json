  "ciq_generated_answer": "\"Tropical cyclones originate over the sea because they intensify over warm tropical oceans, as stated in points [2] and [4] of the context.\"",
  "ciq_answer_evaluation": "CIQ's answer is factually correct and complete, but could be clearer. It refers to 'points [2] and [4] of the context' without explicitly stating what these points are, which may be confusing for readers who don't have access to the original context.",

  "cohere_generated_answer": "Tropical cyclones originate over the sea because they require warm ocean temperatures (above 27\u00b0C) and the Coriolis force, which is absent at the equator, to form and intensify. These conditions are typically found in tropical regions, where warm ocean waters provide the necessary energy for the storm to develop and strengthen.",
