  "cohere_generated_question": "How does the Coriolis effect influence the movement of wind?",
  "ciq_generated_answer": "\"The Coriolis effect influences the movement of wind by causing a deflection in its direction. This deflection is due to the earth's rotation, making the horizontal winds near the earth's surface curve towards the pole for the Northern Hemisphere and away from the pole for the Southern Hemisphere.\"",
  "ciq_answer_evaluation": "CIQ's answer is factually accurate and covers all the relevant information. It is clearly worded and easy to understand, providing a concise explanation of how the Coriolis effect influences wind movement. Well done, CIQ!",

  "cohere_generated_answer": "The Coriolis effect is a phenomenon that influences the movement of wind. Due to the rotation of the Earth, this effect causes the wind to deflect and curve as it moves horizontally near the Earth's surface. In the Northern Hemisphere, the wind is deflected toward the right, or toward the pole, while in the Southern Hemisphere, it is deflected toward the left, or away from the pole. This effect is more pronounced when wind speeds are higher.",
