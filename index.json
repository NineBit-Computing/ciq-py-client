  "ciq_answer_evaluation": "CIQ's answer is factually accurate and clear, but it could be more complete by providing additional context or details from the source text. For example, mentioning the specific conditions required for tropical cyclone formation, such as sea surface temperature and the presence of the Coriolis force, would enhance the answer.",
  "ciq_answer_score": 7,
  "cohere_generated_answer": "Tropical cyclones originate over warm tropical oceans, typically forming in regions where the sea surface temperature exceeds 27\u00b0C. The presence of the Coriolis force, small vertical wind speed variations, and other atmospheric conditions also contribute to their development.",
