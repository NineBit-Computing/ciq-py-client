  "cohere_generated_question": "How do air masses form?",
  "ciq_generated_answer": "\"Air masses form when the air remains over a homogenous area for a sufficiently longer time, acquiring the characteristics of the area. This process occurs on source regions, which are the homogenous surfaces over which air masses form.\"",
  "ciq_answer_evaluation": "CIQ's answer is factually accurate and complete, providing a concise explanation of how air masses form. However, the answer could be clearer by defining 'source regions' and explaining their role in air mass formation.",
  "ciq_answer_score": 8,
  "cohere_generated_answer": "Air masses are formed when air remains over a large, homogenous area long enough to acquire the characteristics of that region. These homogenous areas, known as source regions, can be vast ocean surfaces or expansive plains. As the air sits over these regions, it takes on their unique temperature and humidity traits, becoming distinct air masses with little horizontal variation in composition."
