  "cohere_generated_question": "What are the factors that influence the speed and direction of wind?",
  "ciq_generated_answer": "\"The factors that influence the speed and direction of wind, as per the provided information, are:\\n\\n1. Frictional Force\\n2. Earth's Rotation\\n\\nThe velocity and direction of the wind are the net result of these wind generating forces and also influenced by Pressure.\"",
  "ciq_answer_evaluation": "CIQ's answer is factually accurate and clear, but it could be more comprehensive by mentioning the Coriolis effect as another factor influencing wind patterns.",
  "ciq_answer_score": 8,
  "cohere_generated_answer": "The speed and direction of wind are influenced by multiple factors, including:\n\n- Frictional Force: Friction affects wind speed and is strongest at the surface, extending up to elevations of 1-3 km. It is minimal over the sea.\n- Coriolis Force: The rotation of the Earth deflects wind to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. The deflection is more pronounced when wind velocity is high.\n- Pressure Gradient Force: Differences in atmospheric pressure create a force, with the pressure gradient being stronger where isobars are closer together.\n- Earth's Rotation: The Coriolis effect, caused by the Earth's rotation, influences wind direction.\n\nThese forces, along with gravitational forces, interact to determine the speed and direction of wind.",
